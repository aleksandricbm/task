    <h5>Write the queries for: </h5>
    <ol>
      <li>get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>select `status` from tasks group by `status` order by `status` asc</b></li>
      <li>get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b>select count(tasks.id) as qty, projects.name from tasks inner join projects on (projects.id=tasks.project_id) group by projects.name order by qty desc</b>
      </li>

      <li>get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names : <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>select count(tasks.id) as qty, projects.name from tasks inner join projects on (projects.id=tasks.project_id) group by projects.name order by projects.name asc</b></li>
      
      <li>get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with “N” letter : <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>select tasks.name, projects.name from tasks inner join projects on (projects.id=tasks.project_id) where tasks.name like 'N%' </b></li>
      
      <li> get the list of all projects containing the ‘a’ letter in the middle of the name, and
show the tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist projects without
tasks and tasks with project_id=NULL : <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>select count(tasks.id), projects.name from projects
left outer join tasks  on (projects.id=tasks.project_id)
where projects.`name` like '_%a%_' group by projects.name</b></li>
      
      <li>get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically : <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>select name from tasks group by name  having count(id)>1  order by name asc</b></li>
      
      <li>get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, from
the project ‘Garage’. Order by matches count : <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>select count(tasks.id), tasks.name, tasks.status  from projects
inner join tasks  on (projects.id=tasks.project_id)
where projects.`name` ='Garage' group by  tasks.name, tasks.status
order by count(tasks.id) desc</b></li>
      
      <li>get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status ‘completed’. Order
by project_id : <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>select projects.name from projects
inner join tasks  on (projects.id=tasks.project_id)
where tasks.`status` =1 group by projects.name 
having count(tasks.id)>10 order by projects.id asc</b></li>
    </ol>
